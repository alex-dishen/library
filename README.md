## **Features**
* Ability to add book to the library
* If a user read the book he/she can mark it as 'Read' and if not mark it as 'Not read'
* If the user read the book he/she can rate the book from 0 to 5 using stars
* If the user accidentally stated he/she 'Read' the book, he/she can change book status in the library to 'Not read'. If he/she does so, the stars will disappear.
* If the user created the book with a status 'Not read', he/she can change it's status by clicking on 'Not read' button changing it to 'Read'. Then a little menu will appear to rate the book if user wants
* Ability to delete book from the library
